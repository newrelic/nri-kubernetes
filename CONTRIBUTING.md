# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome. Before contributing please read the
[code of conduct](https://github.com/newrelic/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [search the issue tracker](issues); your issue may have already been discussed or fixed in `main`. To contribute,
[fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository, commit your changes, and [send a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

Note that our [code of conduct](https://github.com/newrelic/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) applies to all platforms and venues related to this project; please follow it in all your interactions with the project and its participants.

## Feature Requests

Feature requests should be submitted in the [Issue tracker](../../issues), with a description of the expected behavior & use case, where they’ll remain closed until sufficient interest, [e.g. :+1: reactions](https://help.github.com/articles/about-discussions-in-issues-and-pull-requests/), has been [shown by the community](../../issues?q=label%3A%22votes+needed%22+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc).
Before submitting an Issue, please search for similar ones in the
[closed issues](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Aenhancement).

## Pull Requests

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
3. Add an entry as an unordered list to the CHANGELOG under the `Unreleased` section under an L3 header that specifies the type of your PR. If there is no L3 header for your type of PR already in the Unreleased section, add a new L3 header. Include your github handle and a link to your PR in the entry. Here's an example of how it should look:
    ```md
      ## Unreleased

      ### bugfix
      - Fix some bug in some file @yourGithubHandle [#123](linkToThisPR)
    ```

  - Here are the accepted L3 headers (case sensitive)
    + `breaking`
    + `security`
    + `enhancement`
    + `bugfix`
    + `dependency`

4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of one other developer, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the other reviewer to merge it for you.
